# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Remove unused code and files, console logs, imports and comments
2. Duplicated Stylesheets, think about how to merge the objects containig the styles
3. Not using the components you built for the actual screens, instead rebuilding everything. There is two issues with that: First, it is the opposite of DRY and basically doubles the work you have to do and second, it makes your code harder to read and maintain because if you want to change something, you need to do so at different points in the code.  
4. Making components too specific so they can't be reused. If we want to make it reusable, make the component less specific and more controlled, a.k.a. pass everything important as props. This will prevent point 3
